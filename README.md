# Valley Of Trolls

Fast-paced territory control game. Turn-based where each turn is exactly 5 seconds long. Be quick to issue your orders, build defenses, look at troops crashing into each other, set fire to villages and fight for domination in the Valley Of Trolls!

# Fixes since submission

- fix1: Soldiers can now correctly meet in battle in the open. Also better intro text explaining the game rules + that you join the next game.
- fix2: Always move full army. Longer timer first turn.
- fix3: Killing trolls spawn new trolls. Better intro text and a youtube video that shows a recording of a previous game while waiting for players.
- fix4: The game now works in firefox, has a better introduction video and another bugfix for soldiers fighting out in the open.
